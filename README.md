# game

## Planning
- It took me a long time to start on this project, for days I wanted to perfect my first project or learn just that little bit more Javascript. I eventually decided to confront it and set aside some time to work on it.
- Creative block was a big problem too, I wanted to create something original and fun, but wasn't sure where to start so I did what all designers do when they're stuck - I made a mind map. This can be found in the planning folder [here](www.github.com), if you're interested. 
    - Moving between different type games online, I found that existing games tended to be split into three categories: 
      - Mutiple choice what font is this game 
      - Shoot the font/serif type font
      - Kern/adjust font yourself
  - I made a basic sketch for a what font game where the user types in the name of the font. 
    - This could have been good, as the user would have to type in rather than just clicking a choice. 
    - Whilst i didn't come across any game identical to this in my research, I wasn't convinced it would be sufficiently interesting so I abandoned the idea. 
  - I had an idea to make a Where's Wally/ Waldo style game but with fonts! I would find examples of images with fonts in them and the user would have to click within a certain area. 
  - I initially wanted to use Helvetica for this game, partly due to its ubiquity, but then I remembered [a video I watched a few years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu91meda2I8) about Cooper Black and it seemed like a better choice because it's about forty years older than Helvetica and the video already includes a ton of examples of the font in street signs. This would save me time in searching for photos for the game, giving me more time to build and debug.

TODO : 

[] asked if can be desktop only game or mobile too on Discord, waiting for response

[ ] Break a feature into smaller parts
[ ] Write pseudocode for each part of a feature
[] Design intuitive user interface 
[] Research Javascript features 
[] Implement Javascript features 


Think about the fundamental elements of a game: user interaction, rules, win/lose conditions, and perhaps a scoring system.

How will the user interact with your game? (for ex. mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or a combination of both)

What are the rules? 

What makes it challenging or engaging ? How does it get harder? 

Win / lose conditions and scoring system. timer maybe 

How does it remain fresh and engaging? Increasing complexity ...

Lastly, find joy in the process! One of the most important aspects of this task is that you enjoy building and playing your game. We're excited to see what you come up with!



 ## Building
DOM 
[] Use JavaScript to respond to user input
[] use Javascript to update user interface 
[] be able to use time intervals in Javascript 
[] Use event listeners to respond to user input 
[] Respond to click events 
[] Respond to key presses 
[] Reference a function within an event listener
[] [ ] Use querySelector() and querySelectorAll() to gather HTML elements

Javascript 
[ ] Understand the syntax of JavaScript functions
[ ] Understand the required and optional parts of a JavaScript function
[] Define a function
[] Call a function 
[] Know how to define arguments in a function and how to pass values in
[] Write functions using traditional and arrow syntax 

[] scoring system

 ## Debugging
 []Identify issues and research solutions 
 [] Ask questions on discord, giving context to others who might like to help 
 [] Use Console.log() to debug code
