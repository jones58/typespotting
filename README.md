## Planning
- It took me a long time to start on this project, for days I wanted to perfect my first project or learn just that little bit more Javascript. I eventually decided to confront it and set aside some time to work on it.
- Creative block was a big problem too, I wanted to create something original and fun, but wasn't sure where to start so I did what all designers do when they're stuck - I made a mind map. This can be found in the planning folder [here](www.github.com), if you're interested. 
    - Moving between different type games online, I found that existing games tended to be split into three categories 
      - Mutiple choice what font is this game
